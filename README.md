# F.R.I.D.A.Y.

Currently live on: assistantfriday.com

Friday is a web assistant designed to help keep track of my passwords and various notes and quicknotes. It is a pet project that has always been redone everytime I learned a new technology stack.

Currently Friday is running with an Angular 4.X frontend paired with a Firebase database. This allows me to curcumvent the need to have a server running 24/7 and keeps the cost of this project to a cool 0$.

This project was a lot of fun to build and has taught me a lot about the web ecosystem and how to get a website up and running. Was interesting to see an idea turn into an actual working website built from the ground up.
